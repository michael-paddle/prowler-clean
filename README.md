## Description

Tool based on AWS-CLI commands for AWS account security assessment and hardening.

## Features

It covers hardening and security best practices for all AWS regions related to the next groups:

- Identity and Access Management (22 checks) [group1]
- Logging (9 checks) [group2]
- Monitoring (14 checks) [group3]
- Networking (4 checks) [group4]
- Extras (37 checks) *see Extras section* [extras]
- Forensics related group of checks [forensics-ready]
- GDPR [gdpr] Read more [here](https://github.com/toniblyx/prowler/issues/189)
- HIPPA [hippa]

For a comprehensive list and resolution look at the guide on the link above.

With Prowler you can:

- get a colorful or monochrome report
- a CSV format report for diff
- run specific checks without having to run the entire report
- check multiple AWS accounts in parallel

## Requirements and Installation

This script has been written in bash using AWS-CLI and it works in Linux and OSX.

- Make sure your AWS-CLI is installed on your workstation, with Python pip already installed:

    ```sh
    pip install awscli
    ```

    Or install it using "brew", "apt", "yum" or manually from <https://aws.amazon.com/cli/>

- Previous steps, from your workstation:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Alfresco/prowler
    cd prowler
    ```

- Make sure you have properly configured your AWS-CLI with a valid Access Key and Region:

    ```sh
    aws configure
    ```

- Make sure your Secret and Access Keys are associated to a user with proper permissions to do all checks. To make sure add SecurityAuditor default policy to your user. Policy ARN is

    ```sh
    arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit
    ```

    > In some cases you may need more list or get permissions in some services, look at the Troubleshooting section for a more comprehensive policy if you find issues with the default SecurityAudit policy.

## Usage

1. Run the `prowler` command without options (it will use your environment variable credentials if they exist or will default to using the `~/.aws/credentials` file and run checks over all regions when needed. The default region is us-east-1):

    ```sh
    ./prowler
    ```

    Use `-l` to list all available checks and group of checks (sections)

1. For custom AWS-CLI profile and region, use the following: (it will use your custom profile and run checks over all regions when needed):

    ```sh
    ./prowler -p custom-profile -r us-east-1
    ```

1. For a single check use option `-c`:

    ```sh
    ./prowler -c check310
    ```

    or for custom profile and region:

    ```sh
    ./prowler -p custom-profile -r us-east-1 -c check11
    ```

    or for a group of checks use group name:

    ```sh
    ./prowler -g group1 # for iam related checks
    ```

1. If you want to save your report for later analysis:

    ```sh
    ./prowler -M mono > prowler-report.txt
    ```

    or if you want a coloured HTML report do:

    ```sh
    pip install ansi2html
    ./prowler | ansi2html -la > report.html
    ```

    or if you want a pipe-delimited report file, do:

    ```sh
    ./prowler -M csv > output.psv
    ```
    or json formatted output using jq, do:

    ```sh
    ./prowler -M json > prowler-output.json
    ```

    or save your report in a S3 bucket:

    ```sh
    ./prowler -M mono | aws s3 cp - s3://bucket-name/prowler-report.txt
    ```

1. If you want to run Prowler to check multiple AWS accounts in parallel (runs up to 4 simultaneously `-P 4`):

    ```sh
    grep -E '^\[([0-9A-Aa-z_-]+)\]'  ~/.aws/credentials | tr -d '][' | shuf |  \
    xargs -n 1 -L 1 -I @ -r -P 4 ./prowler -p @ -M csv  2> /dev/null  >> all-accounts.csv
    ```

1. For help use:

    ```
    ./prowler -h

    USAGE:
        prowler [ -p <profile> -r <region>  -h ]

    Options:
        -p <profile>        specify your AWS profile to use (i.e.: default)
        -r <region>         specify an AWS region to direct API requests to
                                (i.e.: us-east-1), all regions are checked anyway if the check requires it
        -c <check_id>       specify a check id, to see all available checks use -l option
                                (i.e.: check11 for check 1.1 or extra71 for extra check 71)
        -g <group_id>       specify a group of checks by id, to see all available group of checks use -l
                                (i.e.: check3 for entire section 3, forensics-ready to test your account is ready for forensic analysis)
        -f <filterregion>   specify an AWS region to run checks against
                                (i.e.: us-west-1)
        -m <maxitems>       specify the maximum number of items to return for long-running requests (default: 100)
        -M <mode>           output mode: text (default), mono, json, csv (separator is ,; data is on stdout; progress on stderr)
        -k                  keep the credential report
        -n                  show check numbers to sort easier
                                (i.e.: 1.01 instead of 1.1)
        -l                  list all available checks only (does not perform any check)
        -e                  exclude group extras
        -b                  do not print Prowler banner
        -h                  this help
    ```

## How to fix every FAIL

Check your report and fix the issues.  Run again and fix anything still found.  Iterate until nothing is found.

## Troubleshooting

### STS expired token

If you are using an STS token for AWS-CLI and your session is expired you probably get this error:

```
A client error (ExpiredToken) occurred when calling the GenerateCredentialReport operation: The security token included in the request is expired
```

To fix it, please renew your token by authenticating again to the AWS API.

### Custom IAM Policy

Instead of using default policy SecurityAudit for the account you use for checks you may need to create a custom policy with a few more permissions (get and list, not change!) here you go a good example for a "ProwlerPolicyReadOnly":

```json

    "Version": "2012-10-17",

        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": "*"
    }]
}
```

### Incremental IAM Policy

Alternatively, here is a policy which defines the permissions which are NOT present in the AWS Managed SecurityAudit policy. Attach both this policy and the [AWS Managed SecurityAudit policy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit$jsonEditor) to the group and you're good to go.

```sh
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "support:DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Bootstrap Script

Quick bash script to set up a "prowler" IAM user and "SecurityAudit" group with the required permissions. To run the script below, you need user with administrative permissions; set the `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` to use that account.

```sh
export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=default
export ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Account' | tr -d '"')
aws iam create-group --group-name SecurityAudit
aws iam create-policy --policy-name ProwlerAuditAdditions --policy-document file://$(pwd)/iam/prowler-policy-additions.json
aws iam attach-group-policy --group-name SecurityAudit --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit
aws iam attach-group-policy --group-name SecurityAudit --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::${ACCOUNT_ID}:policy/ProwlerAuditAdditions
aws iam create-user --user-name prowler
aws iam add-user-to-group --user-name prowler --group-name SecurityAudit
aws iam create-access-key --user-name prowler
unset ACCOUNT_ID AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE
```

The `aws iam create-access-key` command will output the secret access key and the key id; keep these somewhere safe, and add them to `~/.aws/credentials` with an appropriate profile name to use them with prowler. This is the only time they secret key will be shown.  If you loose it, you will need to generate a replacement.

## Extras

We are adding additional checks to improve the information gather from each account, these checks are out of the scope of the CIS benchmark for AWS but we consider them very helpful to get to know each AWS account set up and find issues on it.

Note: Some of these checks for publicly facing resources may not actually be fully public due to other layered controls like S3 Bucket Policies, Security Groups or Network ACLs.

At this moment we have 37 extra checks:

- 7.1 (`extra71`) Ensure users with AdministratorAccess policy have MFA tokens enabled (Not Scored) (Not part of CIS benchmark)
- 7.2 (`extra72`) Ensure there are no EBS Snapshots set as Public (Not Scored) (Not part of CIS benchmark)
- 7.3 (`extra73`) Ensure there are no S3 buckets open to the Everyone or Any AWS user (Not Scored) (Not part of CIS benchmark)

- 7.29 (`extra729`) Ensure there are no EBS Volumes unencrypted (Not Scored) (Not part of CIS benchmark)
- 7.30 (`extra730`) Check if ACM Certificates are about to expire in 7 days or less (Not Scored) (Not part of CIS benchmark)

To check all extras in one command:

```sh
./prowler -g extras
```

or to run just one of the checks:

```sh
./prowler -c extraNUMBER
```

## Forensics Ready Checks

With this group of checks, Prowler looks if each service with logging or audit capabilities has them enabled to ensure all needed evidences are recorded and collected for an eventual digital forensic investigation in case of incident. List of checks part of this group (you can also see all groups with `./prowler -l`):

- 2.1  Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions (Scored)
- 2.2  Ensure CloudTrail log file validation is enabled (Scored)
- 2.3  Ensure the S3 bucket CloudTrail logs to is not publicly accessible (Scored)
- 2.4  Ensure CloudTrail trails are integrated with CloudWatch Logs (Scored)
- 2.5  Ensure AWS Config is enabled in all regions (Scored)
- 2.6  Ensure S3 bucket access logging is enabled on the CloudTrail S3 bucket (Scored)
- 2.7  Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest using KMS CMKs (Scored)
- 4.3  Ensure VPC Flow Logging is Enabled in all VPCs (Scored)
- 7.12  Check if Amazon Macie is enabled (Not Scored) (Not part of CIS benchmark)
- 7.13  Check if GuardDuty is enabled (Not Scored) (Not part of CIS benchmark)

- 7.24 [extra724] Check if ACM certificates have Certificate Transparency logging enabled (Not Scored) (Not part of CIS benchmark)
- 7.25 [extra725] Check if S3 buckets have Object-level logging enabled in CloudTrail (Not Scored) (Not part of CIS benchmark)


The `forensics-ready` group of checks uses existing and extra checks. To get a forensics readiness report, run this command:

```sh
./prowler -g forensics-ready
```

## Add Custom Checks

In order to add any new check feel free to create a new extra check in the extras group or other group. To do so, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Follow structure in file `checks/check_sample`
2. Name your check with a number part of an existing group or a new one
3. Save changes and run it as `./prowler -c extraNN`
4. Send me a pull request! :)

## Add Custom Groups

1. Follow structure in file `groups/groupN_sample`
1. Name your group with a non existing number
1. Save changes and run it as `./prowler -g extraNN`
1. Send me a pull request! :)

- You can also create a group with only the checks that you want to perform in your company, for instance a group named `group9_mycompany` with only the list of checks that you care or your particular compliance applies.
